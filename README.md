## Development

The below steps assume you've forked and cloned the repo to your local machine.

### Running Ruby and Postgres locally

1.  Bootstrap postgres [with Docker](#running-postgres-with-docker) or [locally](#running-postgres-locally)
2.  Install Ruby v2.7.0 (see `.ruby-version`; also, we recommend [rvm](https://rvm.io/rvm/install) to manage ruby versions.)
3.  Run `bundle`
4.  Install Yarn (On OS X: `brew install yarn`)
5.  Run `yarn`
6.  Run `rails db:create db:migrate`
7.  In one Terminal window, run `bin/webpack-dev-server`. In a second window, run `rails s`.
8.  Visit http://localhost:3000
9.  If working with emails, map localhost to `mailcatcher` in your `/etc/hosts` file and run `gem install --no-document mailcatcher && mailcatcher` in another window.

### Running Postgres with Docker

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

1. `docker-compose up -d`
2. Prefix rails commands with the database url, like this: `export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://127.0.0.1/feedadoc_development?pool=5" && rails s`

### Running Postgress Locally

Install [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) (on OS X you can use `brew` to install it or run [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/)

1. Use `psql` to create a PG user called `feedadoc`.

```
CREATE USER feedadoc WITH SUPERUSER PASSWORD 'password1';
```

### GraphiQL
